Hello, my name is Rue

And for my Final Project for MMP 210, I controlled LEDs with my p5.js Sketch. I had 5 different colored LEDs in my BreadBoard and the same colored 5 circles in p5.js Sketch. 
If I am going to click one of the circles same colored LED will light up. 

In the future, I want to improve this project by adding buttons and more LEDs.
